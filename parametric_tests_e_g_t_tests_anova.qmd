# Parametric Tests (e.g., t-Tests, ANOVA)

Non-Parametric Tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis)
Tests for Categorical Data (e.g., Chi-Square, Fisher’s Exact)
Correlation and Association Tests (e.g., Pearson, Spearman)
Regression Analysis (e.g., Linear, Logistic)
Tests for Variance (e.g., Levene’s, F-Test)
Normality Tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling)
 1. Parametric Tests
These assume underlying statistical distributions (usually normal distribution).
a. t-Tests
One-sample t-test: Compares the sample mean to a known value.
Independent two-sample t-test: Compares means of two independent groups.
Paired t-test: Compares means from the same group at different times.
b. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
One-way ANOVA: Compares means across 3 or more independent groups.
Two-way ANOVA: Examines the effect of two categorical independent variables on a continuous outcome.
c. Z-Test
Similar to t-test but used when population variance is known and sample size is large.
