• Data distribution: describes the distribution shape of data and summarizes the overall structure of the data set. Including normal distribution, skewed distribution, kurtosis, etc.
• Frequency and frequency: count the number of times each value or range appears in the data set, and its proportion in the whole.
• Descriptive charts: use visual means such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc. to show the distribution and rules of data, making it easier for people to understand data.
