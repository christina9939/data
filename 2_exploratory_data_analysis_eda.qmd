# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis is a data analysis method proposed by statistician John W. Tukey. It aims to deeply understand the structure, characteristics and patterns of data sets through drawing and statistical means, discover potential trends and anomalies, and provide a basis for subsequent in-depth analysis and modeling. The goal of EDA is not to conduct strict inferential statistics, but to conduct preliminary, intuitive and comprehensive exploration of data.
The main features of EDA include:
• Visual data: By drawing visual charts such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc., the distribution, relationship and form of data are displayed in an intuitive way.
• Statistical description: Use statistical descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc. to describe the central tendency and dispersion of data.
• Correlation analysis: By calculating the correlation coefficient between variables or drawing a correlation matrix, the relationship between variables is revealed.
• Distribution morphology analysis: Determine the distribution morphology of data, including normality, skewness and kurtosis, to provide a reference for selecting appropriate statistical methods for subsequent modeling.
